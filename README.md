# WSD4HA
provides a simple WSD protocol for scanning documents into homeassistants file system


## **!! actually in development !!**

Creating a WSD service in Home Assistant for my Samsung C480W.
So any documents can always be scanned to the anyways and always running server. Afterwards those documents can be processed from any OCR software like paperless or so. Maybe other printers are working too?

If WSD4HA is being restarted, the scanner needs to be restarted also ! This is due to the fact that the scanner sends out its discovery message only once directly after booting.
